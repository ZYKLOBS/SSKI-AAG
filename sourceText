The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil's gameplay holds various fundamental similarities to that of the PC-98 titles and "Seihou",
 but differs in the introduction of Spell Cards. The pacing has also been changed significantly, but retains some of the PC-98 titles'
  fast pacing, giving the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil a reputation for having a heightened difficulty compared to other Windows titles.
  These aspects were, for the post part, removed in "Perfect Cherry Blossom" and "Imperishable Night".
  A change retained from the PC-98 titles is the "Item Get" feature,
  which allows the player to collect all items on the screen by moving to the top of the screen, if at full power.
  This mechanic was retained in all later games.
