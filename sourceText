Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil (東方紅魔郷　～ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil) is a vertical-scrolling danmaku shoot 'em up, and is the sixth official game in the Touhou Project by Team Shanghai Alice. It is the first to be released specifically for the Windows operating system.

Gameplay:
The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil's gameplay holds various fundamental similarities to that of the PC-98 titles and "Seihou",
 but differs in the introduction of Spell Cards. The pacing has also been changed significantly, but retains some of the PC-98 titles'
  fast pacing, giving the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil a reputation for having a heightened difficulty compared to other Windows titles.
  These aspects were, for the post part, removed in "Perfect Cherry Blossom" and "Imperishable Night".
  A change retained from the PC-98 titles is the "Item Get" feature,
  which allows the player to collect all items on the screen by moving to the top of the screen, if at full power.
  This mechanic was retained in all later games.

  Reception:
  The characters of the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil continue to rank among the highest in Touhou Project character
  popularity polls. In particular, Sakuya Izayoi has consistently been among top 4 in the Touhou Popularity Contests
   held by the Japanese Touhou Wiki since its inception after Comiket 63. Cirno, Remilia Scarlet and Flandre Scarlet
   continue to hold significant popularity amongst the Touhou Project fanbase as well. In addition to Septette for a Dead Princess and U.N. Owen was Her?,
   songs such as Shanghai Alice in Meiji 17 and Shanghai Scarlet Teahouse ~ Chinese Tea gained significant recognition.

In 1992, after five years in Liberty City, gangster Carl "CJ" Johnson (Young Maylay)
returns to Los Santos following his mother's death in a drive-by shooting.
He is intercepted by corrupt C.R.A.S.H. officers led by Frank Tenpenny (Samuel L. Jackson), who threaten to implicate CJ
in the killing of a fellow police officer unless he co-operates with them. CJ returns to Grove Street and reunites with
his brother Sean "Sweet" Johnson (Faizon Love), sister Kendl Johnson (Yolanda Whittaker), and members of his old gang,
Big Smoke (Clifton Powell) and Ryder (MC Eiht). Discovering the Grove Street Families (GSF) have lost much of their territory,
CJ restores the gang to power by helping reunite the various GSF sets who had splintered and forming an alliance with
the Varrios Los Aztecas gang, led by Kendl's boyfriend Cesar Vialpando (Clifton Collins Jr.). Prior to a retaking mission,
CJ is summoned by Cesar on evidence of the drive-by shooting. They witness Smoke and Ryder meeting with Tenpenny and
the rival Ballas gang, eventually discovering their betrayal of the GSF, and their responsibility for killing CJ's mother.
Suspecting a set-up, CJ rushes to Sweet's aid in a showdown against the Ballas.
